Title: “From Frustration to Fascination — Realme P3 Ultra”
[Scene 1 – INT. BEDROOM – DAY] Camera zooms in on a teenage boy tapping his old, laggy phone. The screen freezes. He sighs loudly.
BOY (groaning): “Come on! It’s just one text! Why do you take a century to load?”
He shakes the phone — it glitches, turns off.
BOY: “Perfect. My phone just rage-quit before I could.”
(Sad violin music plays. The boy throws himself onto the bed, defeated.)

[Scene 2 – INT. SAME ROOM – A FEW HOURS LATER] The room lights flicker. A futuristic glow fills the space. A sleek box appears on his desk — slow reveal of the Realme P3 Ultra.
BOY (stunned): “Wait… what is this? A UFO dropped a phone?”
(He picks it up; the phone powers on automatically with a cool AI voice.)
PHONE (AI VOICE): “Hello, Aryan. I’m your Realme P3 Ultra. Ready to upgrade your life?”
BOY (smirking): “Finally, someone who gets me.”

[Scene 3 – MONTAGE] Fast cuts: the boy gaming with zero lag, recording vlogs with AI stabilization, chatting with the AI assistant, taking night photos that look cinematic.
VOICEOVER (energetic, confident tone): “Blazing speed. Smart AI that learns you. And a camera that sees the world like you do — only sharper. That’s the Realme P3 Ultra.”

[Scene 4 – OUTDOOR – SUNSET] The boy walks confidently, phone in hand, friends staring in awe.
FRIEND: “Bro… did your phone just reply to your text before you even typed it?”
BOY (grinning): “Yeah. It’s not just a phone. It’s my Ultra.”

[Scene 5 – PRODUCT CLOSE-UP] The Realme P3 Ultra spins in mid-air with glowing graphics.
VOICEOVER: “Realme P3 Ultra — Smarter. Faster. Unstoppable.” On-screen text: #BeUltra #RealmeP3Ultra
